    <p>WDB have been independent property consultants since 1962. We act for over hundred clients and manage over a thousand properties varying from owners of single properties to multi million pound portfolios. </p>
    <p>The business is an amalgamation of three established companies, Williamsons of Southgate, W. Goodchild &amp; Co, Enfield and St. John &amp; Glossop, Enfield. The partnership has fifty years of experience operating in both commercial and residential property sectors in London and the Home Counties.</p>
      <p>From our office in Southgate, North London, we have been looking after clientâ€™s property building up long term relationships with both landlords and tenants for the past fifty years. </p>
      <p>Both partners of WDB are qualified chartered surveyors and the firm is therefore regulated by the RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).
